Recap of JS String methods. View online here: https://stephendoyle10.github.io/jsstringmethods/

This is my first attempt at writing a html webpage that has javascript functions. I had just completed the javascript course on freecodecamp, which covered a lot of ground, but did not have much on how to integrate JS with HTML, so I had to research that myself.

This programme uses html input form fields that takes a users input and stores it as a JS variable. Then an onclick event does something with this variable, and returns a new value on the webpage.
